# SoloLearn.js
SoloLearn.js is a node.js library for interacting with SoloLearn's mobile API

### This project is still a WIP

The ultimate goal is for this project to cover all API endpoints in both SoloLearn's web and mobile API. (except for tracking/ad endpoints)

Currently, I'm focusing on the mobile API since libraries for the web API already exist.

### Difference between mobile and web

SoloLearn has a mobile app and a website. These use completely different API's and each has its pros and cons.

The biggest difference is that the web API can be used without logging in but lacks a lot of features that the mobile API has. (like profile posts)

### How you can contribute

While the project covers most mobile endpoints, it is still very unfinished.

If you read the documentation, you will probably notice a lot of properties are described as "Unknown value". If you ever figure out what any of these mean, please send a pull request.

If you have any questions or notice an API endpoint is missing, feel free to create an issue.
